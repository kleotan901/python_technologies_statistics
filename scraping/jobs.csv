Responsibilities:- Writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code using programming languages such as Python and Golang;- Developing and maintaining APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for seamless communication between different systems and services;- Working closely with cross-functional teams, including product managers and designers, to translate business requirements into technical solutions;- Participating in code reviews and providing constructive feedback to enhance the overall quality of the teams work.Nice to have:- Experience with Docker/Terraform will be a plus;- Experience in high load projects will be a plus;- Experience with Go will be a plus;- Experience with serverless will be a plus.We offer:- Top-notch products disrupting the world of traditional media-services industry;- Work with brilliant software team with a high level of collaboration and desire to achieve goals;- Flexible working hours;- Corporate equipment for work;- Competitive salary;- The possibility of personal and professional growth. Our Company Cultural Pillars (what we look for in our team members):1. Views technology as progress for humanity: You dont necessarily need to be the most early adopter of early adopters, but at YMM we firmly believe that technology, when used correctly and when access is given equitably, should improve the human experience, and were looking for likeminded team members. 2. Innovative, optimistic, curious, and thinks outside the box: Although introspection, reflection and research are fundamental to a healthy business, to build an Adhocracy we are looking for people who are willing to believe in crazy ideas. An idea for how to practice this: in your next team brainstorm, instead of defining all the reasons an idea wont work, try listing all the reasons it might work.3. Humility & willingness to grow: Everyone in the world is better than you at something. The smartest people always know that theyre not the smartest person, and stay open to constructive feedback (from anyone - not just their superiors) as a tool for continuous growth. The humility to receive feedback without becoming defensive or pointing fingers is crucial to YOs culture. And of course, feedback should always be given following the Radical Candor style. (Radical Candor is required reading!) 4. World-class communicators: When in doubt, overcommunicate. Imagine how many problems in the world have been caused by miscommunication or misunderstandings caused by less-than-perfect communication. Weve all been there - you walk away from an interaction thinking that the other person understood you perfectly, yet find out a few days later that they had a completely different takeaway of the conversation as you did. This is especially a challenge for globally distributed teams who work in several different languages and time zones. We are looking to build a team of world-class communicators (whether written or verbal, but ideally both) in order to improve efficiency, productivity, and happiness at YO (less misunderstandings equals happier workplace). (Required reading: The Story of Everybody, Somebody, Anybody, and Nobody)5. Proactive & problem-solving attitude: Nobody wants to work with somebody who only brings problems to the table and not solutions. Were looking for people who will lead brainstorms, suggest ways to help their coworkers solve problems, or be willing to roll up their sleeves and jump in if their help/skillset is needed (the no task too small attitude). We expect that the first response to a problem is to start finding solutions."

This translates to long wait times and extremely high stress for employees. Currently, the restaurants are experiencing a major hiring crisis due to this extreme stress and increasing minimum wage.Most quick-service restaurants had begun to search for a more elegant solution that improves customer experience, increases speed, accuracy, average ticket size, and reduces employee stress. Our AI greets the customer, takes the order, and inserts it into the point of sale freeing up the employees to focus on other tasks.Understanding an order in the drive-thru using voice is not an easy task and requires deep technology to get to the required high completion rate of orders. The challenges include a very noisy environment, unique speech patterns due to the customer's indecisiveness, different accents, gender, ages, speech from other people in the car, complex multi-turn unstructured conversation, low latency, and more. In order to solve big challenges, we are developing our own speech and natural language understanding tech from the ground up.We are a group of experts in Speech, NLU, and Backend SW. We strongly believe in impact-driven employment where you can work from wherever you're most comfortable and effective. Because of the myriad of challenges and the fast pace, each team member gets to experience a lot of professional growth and ownership.About the Role & Responsibilities:- Our backend is developed all in Python running in the cloud over k8s.- It's not a typical backend interacting with a UI frontend. It handles audio streams in real-time and runs our key AI algorithms.- The role involves designing and implementing complex parts of the backend. This involves distributed architecture as well as concurrency while taking into consideration performance and scale.Requirements- Minimum 5 years of experience as non-web developer- 5+ years experience in Python- Experience in SW design and backend dev- Developed and deployed multiple projects used in production- Experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Microservices, CI/CD, Clouds (AWS/GCP/Azure)- experience with async IO, threading, or concurrent programming- deep control of Python 3 and its standard library.- Lead experience - big advantage Preferred Qualifications:- Experience with real-time audio processingInterview process:- Intro call with HR (30 min)- Live Coding Exercise ( 3 hours) - Technical Interview (1.5 hours)Join us to be a part of an amazing team with great vibes, a company with a lot of freedom of movement, interesting and unique challenges, and an opportunity to influence and build something big."

Senior Python Backend Engineer (non-web development),,5,133,23,"Drive-thru restaurants have employees multi-task by taking orders, packing food, taking payments, and more. This translates to long wait times and extremely high stress for employees. Currently, the restaurants are experiencing a major hiring crisis due to this extreme stress and increasing minimum wage.Most quick-service restaurants had begun to search for a more elegant solution that improves customer experience, increases speed, accuracy, average ticket size, and reduces employee stress.Our AI greets the customer, takes the order, and inserts it into the point of sale freeing up the employees to focus on other tasks.Understanding an order in the drive-thru using voice is not an easy task and requires deep technology to get to the required high completion rate of orders. The challenges include a very noisy environment, unique speech patterns due to the customer's indecisiveness, different accents, gender, ages, speech from other people in the car, complex multi-turn unstructured conversation, low latency, and more.
