About Fluvius

    
      Life Story“Fluvius started on October, 2015 by Georgiy Gres living in Austria that times. The growing of the company from nothing to 7 people in a team and 5 simultaneous projects was very amazing and ambitious way of development during all the following year.In less than 8 months after the start we moved to our first office as the organisational culture and operational communications of the team required this. We were happy. The business developed was good until we acceded 10 people and the management became hard. In the result and fortunately, our business was bankrupt on the eve of the new year and we were gaining fabulous experience from that! Based on this experience, knowledge of business administration and skills of programming, the great initial set of business processes in combination with agile organisational structure was developed.Thereby, Fluvius provides stunning level of services in web and mobile development nowadays, having 100% of satisfied clients mainly thanks to Anton Yakushin for the excellent quality of the code, as well as to Georgiy Gres for our strong business-processes and systems.

About Ajax Systems

    
      Ajax Systems — розробник і виробник систем безпеки Ajax із можливостями розумного дому. Це ціла екосистема з 50 пристроїв, мобільних і десктопних застосунків, серверної інфраструктури. У лінійці Ajax представлено централі керування із власною RTOS (OS Malevich), датчики руху, відчинення, захисту від затоплення та пожежні датчики, вуличні й домашні сирени, тривожна кнопка з функцією керування приладами, розумні розетки та реле.Виробництво Ajax Systems розташовано не в Китаї, а в Україні, і вже п’ять років компанія демонструє кратне зростання як у чисельності команди, так і в кількості користувачів у всьому світі.За розробку пристроїв у Ajax відповідає R&D-департамент, який складається з чотирьох команд: System, Devices, Automation та QA.Команда Devices займається розробленням пристроїв для безпеки й автоматизації. Розробники не винаходять датчики заново, а натомість ставлять перед собою серйозні виклики в таких напрямках:Low-Power — пристрої мають працювати максимально довго від штатних батарей;Собівартість — масовий продукт повинен залишатися в діапазоні середнього цінового сегмента;DFM (Design for Manufacturing) і DFH (Design for Human). Схемотехніка, корпуси та інші елементи має бути легко повторити в сотнях тисяч пристроїв на виробництві без втрати якості.Розробники переважно використовують STM 8/32 і Embedded C. Вже зібрано сильну експертизу й талановитих працівників із числа Hardware- та Embedded C-інженерів, промислових дизайнерів, конструкторів-механіків.Команда Automation розробляє програмно-апаратні комплекси для тестування кожного пристрою в процесі виробництва, створює роботів для автоматизації збирання, а також програмне забезпечення для прошивки пристроїв і керування виробництвом, що дає змогу оптимізувати витрати часу навиготовлення датчиків. Для цього використовують Python 3 та Embedded C.Команда System робить пристрої розумними, перетворюючи їх на повноцінний IoT. Вони створили й розвивають OS Malevich (модульна RTOS для різних апаратних платформ) і хмарний сервіс Ajax Cloud (Java 12, AWS, Akka). Для керування, обслуговування та моніторингу системи користувачами, інсталяторами й інженерами охоронних компаній розроблені додатки для iOS (Objective-C, Swift), Android (Java, Kotlin), Windows/macOS (Python, QT, QML).Системи безпеки мають підвищені вимоги до надійності та стабільності роботи, тому команда QA в Ajax Systems супроводжує продукт як на етапі розроблення, так і в процесі виробництва й подальшого розвитку. Вони виявляють баги у залізі, софті або взаємодіях систем. Це не просто команда «клікерів», це творчі інженери. Вони перевіряють нові пристрої в різних екстремальних умовах: імітують рухи людей і тварин, відтворюють складні погодні умови, перепади температур, влаштовують контрольовані пожежі та затоплення.Ми будуємо невеликі команди та створюємо такі умови, щоб робочий час ішов безпосередньо на дослідження й розробку замість нескінченних зустрічей і обговорень. Для нас ідеї та рішення важливіші за титули, тому ми не використовуємо класичні айтішні ґрейди — Senior/Middle/Junior.У нас багато пропрієтарних технологій. Наприклад, ми впроваджуємо в ДНК продукту можливості й технології, скопіювати які настільки трудомістко, що навіть не має сенсу. Такими розробками стали радіопротоколи Jeweller і Wings, операційна система OS Malevich, алгоритми датчиків і багато іншого.Датчики Ajax охороняють сотні тисяч користувачів у більш ніж 130 країнах світу. Кожен датчик, який ми випускаємо, проходить контроль якості, а рівень повернення й браку — в межах статистичної похибки.Виробництво Ajax Systems налічує два заводи, що розташовані в Україні. Також у нас чотири R&D-офіси: у Києві, Харкові, Вінниці і Львові.Ми не релізимо лайно і шукаємо людей, які не йдуть на компроміси в якості своєї роботи.

That is why, as one of our benefits, we offer the services of a private assistant. Appointments, research, online shopping, and more – you choose which tasks to pass on to your assistant.Expert Python engineer wantedDo you have at least 5 years of programming experience – not necessarily professional – including at least a year with Python? If so, you have probably written so much Python code in your life that at times you want to express your thoughts through list comprehensions. Thanks to your extensive experience, you can solve any problem that gets thrown at you, but that is not enough – you come up with multiple solutions for every issue, and you always know how to choose the most Pythonic one.And that is all a good sign – a sign that means you’re exactly the type of person that we’re looking for! If you’d like to see what it’s like to work with Python natives who all bring their long-standing expertise to the table, please get in touch. Spoiler alert: it’s great.We have good manners, though, so let us introduce ourselves first. Do you want to find out more about the company? We were hoping you’d ask.Get to know your future companyReef Technologies is a fully remote Python backend software house. We’re a small, agile, senior-only team. All of our current members have more than seven years of strong experience, so we don’t ever have anything urgent to fix. We only deliver stable solutions, as we have developed a system that has delivered more than a hundred challenging projects in the last three years. We’d like to improve it even further with you on the team.The demand for our work is extremely high, so we get to pick and choose the projects that we want to take on – and the same goes for you. Before you’re assigned to a project, you’ll be personally asked if you’re interested in that particular task and if you don’t like it, you’ll just get something else. That’s the beauty of having a sales team that greatly outperforms our delivery capacity.Let your code have a real impactAt Reef Technologies, we don’t have managers. Thanks to the group decision-making framework, Sociocracy 3.0, every member of the team can be sure that their opinion will be valued. (Check it out here, you’ll wonder how you’d survived in traditional organizations until now!) The Founder of our company doesn’t only take care of sales, bureaucracy, and client relationships - he is also a programmer, so all of us really do work together and understand the job at hand.What type of projects would you work on? We mainly accept offers from startups and small-to-medium businesses from the US, the UK, and Canada. Some projects may only last a couple of hours, while others take even a few years for us to complete. There is one thing that you can be sure of, though - that it will always be your personal choice whether to work on a particular project or reject it. What would you have thought about these?-financial data warehouse, which aggregates over 31 000 time series into a few hundred charts for a fintech company from London-graph data search/visualization system for auditors/investigators from Norway-super scalable WAF optimized down to extremely low running costs for a client from Chicago, IL-multisource cloud object synthesizer library for a storage provider from San Mateo, CA-report generator/inventory tracker for an e-commerce/healthcare company from Canada-k8s-based revenue optimizer for large private GPU compute clusters in North America-paper product level tracker for toilet cleaners from Canada-hydrant certification report generator for Australian plumbers-multi-tenant hospitality management system for large properties in the US-large scale information display system for retailers (international)We have already delivered those, but you can be sure we’ve got even more exciting projects coming up in the future. All that without ever setting foot in an office. We have completed those projects – and many more – from the comfort of our own homes, from tropical beaches and from our favorite coffee shops. Some of us work early in the morning, others start off late in the night. Each of us is free to choose their own programming environment. We know our engineers are competent enough to organize their work and achieve top productivity in their own way. Do you think you'd enjoy this type of freedom? Become one of us and make the world a better place by delivering more than just lines of code.Want to know more?-Check out the Reef Technologies Handbook to see our company policies (https://github.com/reef-technologies/handbook).-Want to see what our clients have to say about our work?

About Ajax Systems

    
      Ajax Systems — розробник і виробник систем безпеки Ajax із можливостями розумного дому. Це ціла екосистема з 50 пристроїв, мобільних і десктопних застосунків, серверної інфраструктури. У лінійці Ajax представлено централі керування із власною RTOS (OS Malevich), датчики руху, відчинення, захисту від затоплення та пожежні датчики, вуличні й домашні сирени, тривожна кнопка з функцією керування приладами, розумні розетки та реле.Виробництво Ajax Systems розташовано не в Китаї, а в Україні, і вже п’ять років компанія демонструє кратне зростання як у чисельності команди, так і в кількості користувачів у всьому світі.За розробку пристроїв у Ajax відповідає R&D-департамент, який складається з чотирьох команд: System, Devices, Automation та QA.Команда Devices займається розробленням пристроїв для безпеки й автоматизації. Розробники не винаходять датчики заново, а натомість ставлять перед собою серйозні виклики в таких напрямках:Low-Power — пристрої мають працювати максимально довго від штатних батарей;Собівартість — масовий продукт повинен залишатися в діапазоні середнього цінового сегмента;DFM (Design for Manufacturing) і DFH (Design for Human). Схемотехніка, корпуси та інші елементи має бути легко повторити в сотнях тисяч пристроїв на виробництві без втрати якості.Розробники переважно використовують STM 8/32 і Embedded C. Вже зібрано сильну експертизу й талановитих працівників із числа Hardware- та Embedded C-інженерів, промислових дизайнерів, конструкторів-механіків.Команда Automation розробляє програмно-апаратні комплекси для тестування кожного пристрою в процесі виробництва, створює роботів для автоматизації збирання, а також програмне забезпечення для прошивки пристроїв і керування виробництвом, що дає змогу оптимізувати витрати часу навиготовлення датчиків. Для цього використовують Python 3 та Embedded C.Команда System робить пристрої розумними, перетворюючи їх на повноцінний IoT. Вони створили й розвивають OS Malevich (модульна RTOS для різних апаратних платформ) і хмарний сервіс Ajax Cloud (Java 12, AWS, Akka). Для керування, обслуговування та моніторингу системи користувачами, інсталяторами й інженерами охоронних компаній розроблені додатки для iOS (Objective-C, Swift), Android (Java, Kotlin), Windows/macOS (Python, QT, QML).Системи безпеки мають підвищені вимоги до надійності та стабільності роботи, тому команда QA в Ajax Systems супроводжує продукт як на етапі розроблення, так і в процесі виробництва й подальшого розвитку. Вони виявляють баги у залізі, софті або взаємодіях систем. Це не просто команда «клікерів», це творчі інженери. Вони перевіряють нові пристрої в різних екстремальних умовах: імітують рухи людей і тварин, відтворюють складні погодні умови, перепади температур, влаштовують контрольовані пожежі та затоплення.Ми будуємо невеликі команди та створюємо такі умови, щоб робочий час ішов безпосередньо на дослідження й розробку замість нескінченних зустрічей і обговорень. Для нас ідеї та рішення важливіші за титули, тому ми не використовуємо класичні айтішні ґрейди — Senior/Middle/Junior.У нас багато пропрієтарних технологій. Наприклад, ми впроваджуємо в ДНК продукту можливості й технології, скопіювати які настільки трудомістко, що навіть не має сенсу. Такими розробками стали радіопротоколи Jeweller і Wings, операційна система OS Malevich, алгоритми датчиків і багато іншого.Датчики Ajax охороняють сотні тисяч користувачів у більш ніж 130 країнах світу. Кожен датчик, який ми випускаємо, проходить контроль якості, а рівень повернення й браку — в межах статистичної похибки.Виробництво Ajax Systems налічує два заводи, що розташовані в Україні. Також у нас чотири R&D-офіси: у Києві, Харкові, Вінниці і Львові.Ми не релізимо лайно і шукаємо людей, які не йдуть на компроміси в якості своєї роботи.

Senior Python Backend Engineer (non-web development),5,114,15,"Drive-thru restaurants have employees multi-task by taking orders, packing food, taking payments, and more. This translates to long wait times and extremely high stress for employees. Currently, the restaurants are experiencing a major hiring crisis due to this extreme stress and increasing minimum wage.Most quick-service restaurants had begun to search for a more elegant solution that improves customer experience, increases speed, accuracy, average ticket size, and reduces employee stress.Our AI greets the customer, takes the order, and inserts it into the point of sale freeing up the employees to focus on other tasks.Understanding an order in the drive-thru using voice is not an easy task and requires deep technology to get to the required high completion rate of orders. The challenges include a very noisy environment, unique speech patterns due to the customer's indecisiveness, different accents, gender, ages, speech from other people in the car, complex multi-turn unstructured conversation, low latency, and more. In order to solve big challenges, we are developing our own speech and natural language understanding tech from the ground up.We are a group of experts in Speech, NLU, and Backend SW. We strongly believe in impact-driven employment where you can work from wherever you're most comfortable and effective. Because of the myriad of challenges and the fast pace, each team member gets to experience a lot of professional growth and ownership.About the Role & Responsibilities:- Our backend is developed all in Python running in the cloud over k8s.- It's not a typical backend interacting with a UI frontend.

About Fluvius

    
      Life Story“Fluvius started on October, 2015 by Georgiy Gres living in Austria that times. The growing of the company from nothing to 7 people in a team and 5 simultaneous projects was very amazing and ambitious way of development during all the following year.In less than 8 months after the start we moved to our first office as the organisational culture and operational communications of the team required this. We were happy. The business developed was good until we acceded 10 people and the management became hard. In the result and fortunately, our business was bankrupt on the eve of the new year and we were gaining fabulous experience from that! Based on this experience, knowledge of business administration and skills of programming, the great initial set of business processes in combination with agile organisational structure was developed.Thereby, Fluvius provides stunning level of services in web and mobile development nowadays, having 100% of satisfied clients mainly thanks to Anton Yakushin for the excellent quality of the code, as well as to Georgiy Gres for our strong business-processes and systems. Special thanks to all our partners and employees for solving hard problems, accepting of innovations and development for the better!Fluvius always stays at the source of success of its clients, since the Client is the core value. Moreover, we heavily strive to make successful the clients of our clients providing rather the complex interactive business support, than only the programming services.”

About Confitech Dienstleistungs GmbH

    
      Im Jahr 2000 begannen wir mit Engineering-Themen im Automotivbereich. Aus der Begeisterung fürs Auto und dem Wunsch Mobilität umweltgerecht zu gestalten, erfolgte unser Engagement ins CarSharing in 2006 an unserem Unternehmensstandort Ulm. Das Thema ""bedarfsgerechte Mobilität"" wurde in 2017 durch die Übernahme einer traditionsreichen Nutzfahrzeugvermietung in Stuttgart erweitert. Neben Applikationstätigkeiten im Automotivbereich bekamen in den vergangenen Jahren die Themen Funktionsentwicklung und Software-Testing einen immer höheren Stellenwert. Folgerichtig wurde deshalb in 2020 ein eigenständiger Bereich für die IT-Entwicklung ins Leben gerufen.
